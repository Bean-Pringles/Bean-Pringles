<p>C+ is a language that compiles directly to C. It maintains C's power while making it easier to understand and read. With one-to-one line translation, experienced C developers can translate their code into C+ with ease. The compiler, written in Python, has helpful and descriptive error messages to help the average developer. C+ is designed to get new people into C without the headaches, but with the power

<p>Rachet is a compiler-based programming language designed for school students to design their custom operating system easily and without the normal rigors. Rachet has a high-level syntax similar to Python and a bit like Rust. This simple syntax is essential to hooking students onto OS Dev. Rachet is an easy-to-use, plug-and-play language that has almost limitless possibilities.</p>

<p>Cog-OS is a minimal operating system built using Rust, designed to run on x86_64 architecture. It provides a simple kernel that can be compiled and run using QEMU. The project includes a commands.txt file where users can specify commands to be executed, with available commands defined in the src/commands directory. To get started, users can navigate to the install directory and run cargo bootimage to compile the kernel, then use QEMU to launch the OS. Future updates may include features like USB driver support, directory management, cross-boot saving, and Python support for the spoke module.</p>

<p>Spoke is a lightweight Python alternative that has a mix of syntax between Python, TI-Basic, and Rust. Spoke was mainly more of a prototype of Rachet, but can still hold its own against most other indie languages. Spoke has a modular command system and a package manager. You can even make your own commands and have other people install them.</p>
